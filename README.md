# Welcome

Welcome to my LineMapper project. It currently does not have a goal. 
It currently consists of the harp.gl mapping tool with the NS (Dutch National Rail) train map on top with active train locations.

# Getting started

Create a .env file in the root directory. 
Add HERE_API_KEY="`YOUR API KEY`" with your Here Platform API key
